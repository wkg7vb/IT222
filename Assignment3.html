    <h1>Part 1</h1>
    <img src="Assignment3/breaching whale.jpg" alt="A humpback whale breaching" />
    <p>This is an image from the internet I have chosen to edit. </p>

    <h1>Part 2</h1>
    <img src="Assignment3/breaching whale edited.jpg" alt="same image but edited" />
    <p>This image has been cropped, has a border, and was made slightly larger. It also has a warmer color palette.</p>

    <h1>Part 3</h1>
    <img src="Assignment3/collage.png" alt="collage" />
    <br />
    <img src="Assignment3/ag antialiasing.png" alt="antialised text" />
    <br />
    <img src="Assignment3/ag antialiasing zoomed.png" alt="zoomed" />
    <p>
        This antialiased text has much more blurry edges when zoomed. <br />
        However it still prevents the edges from looking like stairs. <br />
        I didn't really consider my site background color when creating this collage with a transparent background. <br />
        I don't think it really caused an issue this time but it certainly could in the future.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <h3>JPEG 33KB</h3>
                <img src="Assignment3/hose and rainbow.jpg" alt="JPEG image" />
            </td>
            <td>
                <h3>PNG 198KB</h3>
                <img src="Assignment3/hose and rainbow.png" alt="PNG image" />
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <h3>BMP 426KB</h3>
                <img src="Assignment3/hose and rainbow.bmp" alt="BMP image" />
            </td>
            <td>
                <h3>GIF 51KB</h3>
                <img src="Assignment3/hose and rainbow.gif" alt="GIF image" />
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        Of the four images, It is very difficult to distinguish between the JPEG, PNG and BMP files as far as quality goes, while the GIF was clearly compressed and lacks the same color range. <br />
        The JPEG has the smallest size, followed by the GIF, then the PNG, and the BMP has the largest. <br />
        I think that JPEG files would be best for webpages because the JPEG is the smallest file with indistinguishable quality from the larger files types.

    <h1>Part 5</h1>
    <img src="Assignment3/mysteryletterssmall.jpg" alt="small mystery letters" />
    <img src="Assignment3/mysteryletters.jpg" alt="zoomed mystery letters" />
    <p>
        The letter A on the left is a raster image, meaning that the antialising that was done to the text will not adapt to different zoom levels. <br />
        The letter A on the right is a vector representation of the letter, which will adapt its properties such as antialiasing to different zoom levels.
