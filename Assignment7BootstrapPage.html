<body>
    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color: #2737ff">
        <p>
            This is a 3 span column. <br />
            It could be used for navigation.<br />
            But since there is only one page here, I'll just use it to introduce this page.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9" style="background-color: #273700">
        <p>
            This is an 9 span column. <br />
            It could be used for the main content of the page.
            <br /> <br />
            The bootstrap style sheet has inexplicably changed some aspects of my own style sheet, such as the underlined links, font sizes, default margins, horizontal rules, etc. Basically any style that my sheet did not directly address, and therefore left default, was changed by the bootstrap style sheet. I have tried to remedy some of these aspects by directly addressing them, but there are simply too many for me to know all the fixes. You can veiw the bootstrap style sheet <a href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">here</a>.
            <br /> <br />
            As you can see, the "navigation" column stays short, with its text, and <i>this</i> column gets long, with its text, which would be unnoticable to the end user if the background colors matched the page background colors.
